# Hop Race — devlog

## 2026-10-21 — GDD owner review and art direction
- Owner review applied: smaller one-screen levels with a fixed camera, landscape only, falls send you back to the start, ice and sticky floors, one flag trigger box. GDD now names the age range (core 13–24) and tone.
- Art direction settled after trying six looks on the "Hop Race Art Direction" canvas: two-tone minimal (look D). One flat background color per world, solid dark level pieces, players as flat squares with no outline and one big googly eye. The Toybox Flat mockup was too close to an existing game.
- Next: critical review pass (1c); team agrees on the new art family; a teammate reviews the GDD for approval.

## 2026-10-21 — GDD first draft
- Phase 1a questions answered; wrote `GDD.md` (Status: Draft).
- Decisions: 4 modes as worlds of 10 levels (Hop = Classic + Wall Jump, Rocket, Grapple, Sand = Flow + Flow 2); Orbit and Rocket (pits) cut. Solo time trial with stars and a ghost is the main path; 2-player Versus on any level. All levels unlocked behind one switchable rule. No daily. LittleJS kept.
- Next: critical review pass (1c), then a teammate reviews for approval.

## 2026-10-19 — Moved into coolmath-pilot
- Moved from its own repo (onebutton-twoplayer-game) with its git history; added this brief, `mechanic.svg`, devlog and meta for the dashboard.
- Current state: playable LittleJS prototype, 2 players with one key each, six modes in the menu (Classic, Wall Jump, Rocket Jump, Grappling Hook, Flow, Flow 2); keyboard only, no shell, saving or analytics.
- Next: write `GDD.md` for what is built (phase 1) and decide which modes ship and whether there is a solo mode.

## 2026-10-01 — Prototype: hop race and five more modes
- First playable: hold to charge and sweep the aim, release to hop; first to the flag wins. Wall Jump mode clings to walls.
- Rocket Jump: a spinning launcher; blasts push you and open a gate via a ceiling button. Grappling Hook: fire, reel in, cut loose keeping your speed.
- Flow: crumble into sand that pours down slopes and packs back into a square. Flow 2: a fire pit turns you to gas that slides up the ceiling to a hanging flag, then condenses back through liquid.
- Orbit and Rocket Jump (pits) are hidden from the menu.
